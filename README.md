## Objective

The goal of this project is to perform data analysis on a retail sales dataset using SQL. The objective is to uncover business insights by querying sales data effectively, identifying high-value customers, evaluating product performance, and understanding revenue trends by category, region, and customer behavior.

## Tools Used

>- MySQL

>- BMS Tool (MySQL Workbench)

>- CSV/Excel (for dataset required)

>- Git & GitHub (for version control)

## Steps Included

>- Created a dedicated database named project.

>- Imported the sales dataset into a table named da_sales.

>- Performed data exploration and filtering using SQL queries.

>- Used aggregate functions and conditional filtering for summary statistics.

>- Interpreted results to draw key business insights.

## Analysis Included

>- Filtered high-value transactions (e.g., orders above â‚¹25,000 in economy mode)

>- Sales trends in specific geographies and categories (e.g., Technology in Ireland)

>- Identification of most profitable sales using calculated fields

>- Customer segmentation based on naming patterns and total spend

>- Revenue contribution by city and product category

>- Aggregated business metrics: total revenue, average cost, total orders

>- Ranking customers using DENSE_RANK to identify top contributors

## Key Insights

>- A significant number of high-value orders are shipped via economy mode, indicating potential customer price sensitivity.
